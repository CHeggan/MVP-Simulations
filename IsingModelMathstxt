Metropolis : Accept if DelE <_ or equal to 0
            :otherwise accept with exp(-DelE/kT)


deltaE = -1()


Want total enegry, cheat for this is to just use two nn, maybe up and left,
moving across full thing accounts for all points

2J diff in delta E

DelE = -2J(Si)[s2 + s3 + s4 + s5]


for kawasaki:
  - want to ranodmly select two spins
  - find indices of their NN
  - compare this to the actula lattice sites themselves
  - Then move on to sending each to their own delE calculation
  - if they are NN of one another, take off -J(si*sj) from DelE at end
  - this gives final value which we can evaluate

magnetisation:
  - <m> = sum(m(mu))/n
  - m = M/N = sum(s_i)/N
  - <m^2> = sum(m^2)/n
  - <m>^2 = (sum(m)n)^2


- 10000 sweeps total for each temp
- n^2 attempted flips per sweep
- start from T = 1
- mag is sum then absolute
